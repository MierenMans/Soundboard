its quite easy to setup and only requires a few steps.

1. go to Luamacros.exe 

2. Click the most left button(looks a bit like printer) and open keyboard.lua

3. go to line 22 and replace the %user%(full path is: C:\\Users\\%user%\\Desktop\\Soundboard\\keypressed.txt) and replace it with your username.
3. My username is Mens so for me its C:\\Users\\mens\\Desktop\\Soundboard\\keypressed.txt

4. save the file and run it with the triangle button.

5. now just press a random key on the keyboard and your lua script is functional

6. download autohotkey at https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ if you don't do this your soundboard won't work

7. now rightclick the soundkeys.ahk file and click edit script

8. go to line 13 and replace %user%(full path is: C:\Users\%user%\Desktop\Soundboard\keypressed.txt) with your username
8. My username is Mens so for me its C:\Users\mens\Desktop\Soundboard\keypressed.txt

9. click save and run the script.

10. congratz you got 2 scripts running that do nothing yet.

11. open EXP-Soundboard_05.exe

12. make some sound effects and press a key on the second keyboard. the second keyboard should press *key* + shift + minus

13. now you got a fully working soundboard(there are a few more steps so more people can hear it in discord, but that isn't my problem)

btw feel free to make more additions to the ahk script and if you need any help with it, i'm in my discord(https://discord.gg/bNqTs54) or in darren's discord
